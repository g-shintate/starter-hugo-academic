Gustavo Shintate is a marine scientist and translator. His research interests include Marine Ecology, Paleoecology, Conservation Biology, Sci-comm and Asian Diaspora. He is currently working as an academic consultant and freelance Translator and looking for opportunities in Scotland.

He also thinks that it is extremely weird to refer to himself in third person. He concludes that every day is indeed a school day. csdfgfdh
