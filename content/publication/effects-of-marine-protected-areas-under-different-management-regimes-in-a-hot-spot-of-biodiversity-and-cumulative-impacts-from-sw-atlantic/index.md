abstract: Marine protected areas (MPAs) represent a useful tool for resource
  management, as well as to conserve and/or restore biological communities. The
  level of protection is key factor influencing the marine biodiversity, where a
  more enforced protection is expected to drive positive outcomes. In 2008, a
  large MPAs network (11,380 km 2) was established in one of off the most
  populated and industrialized areas in the world (i.e., São Paulo State coast,
  southeast Brazil). Given many goods and services provided by marine
  ecosystems, this MPA network represents the most challenging marine
  conservation initiative in Brazil. Harboring​ areas with different
  socio-ecological contexts and management regimes, this MPA network provides a
  unique opportunity to investigate the effects of cumulative impacts. We
  contrasted the biomass and size structure of reef fish in three subtropical
  islands under different levels of enforcement. We analyzed the influence of
  variables as island size, benthic cover, depth, topographic complexity, wave
  exposure, and protection level on the biomass of reef fish assemblages.
  Protection level was the main attribute responsible to explain the high
  biomass of fish target species and small territorial herbivores. In sites
  sheltered from the waves, the biomass of groupers was 1600% higher within
  enforced area than that from open-access area. Beyond the idea of positive
  effects of enforcement on reef fish biomass and size, we add evidences that
  even under multiple stressors, the area-based management is still a strong
  tool to marine conservation.

  Highlights

  • Reef fish communities presented positive effects from the protection against fisheries.


  • Groupers was the group that best responded to the different levels of protection.


  • Larger groupers and snappers were more frequent in the no-take MPAs.


  • Herbivores were more frequent in the open-access area.
