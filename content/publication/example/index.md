abstract: The Atlantic Ocean encompasses approximately 10% of the global
  carbonate reef area, but the austral limits of coral reef distribution within
  this basin are still unclear. The lack of reef area and distribution estimates
  clearly hampers marine spatial planning and management in several regions,
  especially in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. In this area, significant
  freshwater, nutrient, and terrigenous sediment inputs constrain the detection
  of subtidal features by remote sensing. Here, we describe the coral reef of
  Queimada Grande Island (QGI) (24Â°S). The documented reef covers approximately
  75,000 m2 between depths of 7 and 12 m, forming a relatively flat-topped
  plateau that fringes the leeward (W) side of the island. The framework was
  built mainly by M. decactis colonies that were cemented in place by crustose
  coralline algae (CCA). This peculiar structure lays approximately 1000 km
  south of the Abrolhos reefs, within a tropical-subtropical transition zone,
  constituting the southernmost Atlantic carbonate reef built by corals already
  reported. Our data reveal the enormous scientific and biodiversity
  conservation value hidden at the coastal islands of the Brazilian
  Biogeographical Province. Despite the high levels of fisheries activities, we
  found living coral coverage similar to that of southwestern Atlantic marine
  protected areas.
