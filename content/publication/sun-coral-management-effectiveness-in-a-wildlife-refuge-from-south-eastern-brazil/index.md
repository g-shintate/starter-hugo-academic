  The introduction of exotic species is one of the major causes for biodiversity
  loss in marine environments. Introduced species can change habitat complexity,
  impacting local communities and altering ecosystem functioning.

  Since the 1980s, the scleractinian species Tubastraea coccinea and Tubastraea. tagusensis (commonly known as sun corals) have been spreading in the south-western Atlantic, posing a major threat to local biodiversity and marine ecosystems. Nowadays, these species are reported from more than 3,500 km along the Brazilian coast and on at least 21 oil and gas offshore platforms.

  Considering the great environmental pressure resulting from sun coral invasion, this study verified the effectiveness of manual removal of Tubastraea spp. along a rocky shore in Alcatrazes Wildlife Refuge, one of the most pristine marine regions in Brazil.

  Results indicate that removal is indeed effective as a control technique; however, as invaders have high regeneration capabilities and recruitment rates, successive management efforts are essential. In order for management to be effective against Tubastraea's year-round release of clonal larvae, results suggest invaded areas should receive at least two management actions per year.

  Successive management efforts, in addition to the development of new techniques and prevention of new invasions should be priorities for mitigating sun coral impacts.
