abstract: Whilst the impacts of climatic and oceanographic change on lower
  latitude reefs are increasingly well documented, our understanding of how
  reef-building has fluctuated in higher latitude settings remains limited.
  Here, we explore the timing and longevity of reef-building through the mid- to
  late Holocene in the most southerly known reef (24°S) in the Western Atlantic.
  Reef core data show that reef growth was driven by a single coral species,
  Madracis decactis, and occurred over two phases since ~6000 calibrated (cal.)
  yr B.P.. These records further indicate that there was a clear growth hiatus
  from ~5500 to 2500 cal. yr B.P., and that there is no evidence of reef
  accretion on the Queimada Grande Reef (QGR) over the past 2000 yrs. It thus
  presently exists as a submerged senescent structure colonized largely by
  non-reef building organisms. Integration of these growth data with those from
  sites further north (18°S and 21°S) suggests that Intertropical Convergence
  Zone (ITCZ), South Westerlies Winds (SWW) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation
  (ENSO) variability and shifts during the Holocene drove changes in the
  position of the Brazil-Falklands/Malvinas Confluence (BFMC), and that this has
  had a strong regional influence on the timing and longevity of reef growth.
  Our results add new evidence to the idea that reef growth in marginal settings
  can rapidly turn-on or -off according to regional environmental changes, and
  thus are of relevance for predicting high latitude reef growth potential under
  climate change.
